# Book Store

## About

 * The bookstore indexes books by ISBN. A book is only known to the bookstore if it has been indexed.  
 All indexed books have:
   * A price in CAD
   * A title
   * An author
   * An abstract / description
 * The bookstore chain has agencies in different cities.
   * There can not be two agencies in the same city
   * Each city has a stock, that tells the amount in store for the indexed books.
 * The bookstore chain stores reader feedback for books (comments)
   * Comments are anonymous and have no author
   * Only indexed books can be commented
   * Comments can be updated
   * Comments must not be empty
